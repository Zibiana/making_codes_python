Actually, we can tidy things up a little by noting that shift encryption is just a special case of affine encryption where $m = 1$. (I've changed the code below so that $m = 1$ is the default value of $m$. If we want shift encryption, that allows us to leave out the argument for $m$ altogether if we want.) So we really only have to load functions for affine encryption/decryption and frequency analysis.\n",
