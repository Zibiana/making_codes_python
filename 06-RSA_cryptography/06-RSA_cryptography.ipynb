    "## A bit of history\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA is named for its creators, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman who were building on the work of Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle. They began thinking about what functions did they know that were \"one\\-way.\" That is they were looking for a mathematical function that was easy to do, but hard to undo. For a non example, shifting is easy to do. We just take a number and add 5 to it. BUT it is also easy to undo. We just take our new number and subtract 5 from it. So shifting is not an example of a one way function. They began to build on what Diffie and Hellman had noticed. Numbers are really easy to multiply in the grand scheme of things. But as you all know from experience, it is very hard to find their factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fun fact! While Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, Diffie, Helman and Merkle were working on their public key cryptography ideas at Universities, the same ideas were being explored in governments in secret starting even before them in the 1960s. James Ellis first showed the existence of public key style cryptographies was possible. Then Clifford Cocks then built on Ellis' \"whacky idea\" and created what we now know as RSA asymmetric cipher in 1973 \\(four years before Rivest, Shamir and Adleman\\). His friend Malcolm Williamson then tried to disprove Cocks theory and failed to do so but in the process developed D\\-H key exchange. It's interesting to see that timeline wise the ideas came out in opposite orders! Of course, they don't receive recognition for their groundbreaking work because this information was classifies until December 1997. As is always the case with the history of cryptography, government, and secrecy Ellis did not live long enough to see the world acknowledge his contributions. \n",
