Let's explore how the math works.\n\nFirst, Alicia and Beto need to choose a prime number $p$. This number will be publicly known; it is not a secret. For purposes of exposition, suppose $p = 17$. \\(In reality, this prime will be much, much larger.\\) Next, Alicia and Beto need to decide on $g$ which will need to be a _unit_ mod 17, in other words, a number that is relatively prime to 17. \\(Of course, if we start with a prime number $p$, all possible choices of $g$ will be relatively prime to 17 as long as we don't pick 0 or 1.\\) Let's suppose $g = 3$. This number is also publicly known.\n\nNow, both Alicia and Beto need to choose their own separate private keys. These can be any numbers whatsoever. Say Alicia's private key is $a = 15$ and Beto's private key is $b = 13$.\n\nThe important expression is\n\n$$\ng^{x} \\mod p\n$$\n\nwhere $g = 3$ and $p = 17$. We'll see how to use the exponent $x$ in a moment.\n\nUsing the numbers in this example, we have\n\n$$\n3^{x} \\mod 17.\n$$\n\nAgain, just as a reminder, every part of the above expression is public knowledge.\n\nHere's where the secret private keys play their part. Alicia uses her private key as the exponent first:\n\n$$\n3^{15} \\mod 17.\n$$\n\nIn symbols,\n\n$$\ng^{a} \\mod p\n$$\n\nWe can use Python to compute this easily:\n\n","pos":42,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

If Alicia wants to send a secret object to Beto in that box, both Alicia and Beto will need copies of the key.

Suppose that both Alicia and Beto have their own padlocks with their own private keys. Then they can execute the following procedure:\n\n- Alicia puts the secret object in a box, locks it, and sends it to Beto.\n- Beto locks the box again with his lock and sends the box back to Alicia.\n- Alicia removes her lock and sends the box back to Beto.\n- Beto removes the final lock and accesses the secret object.\n\nThis is called a \"double\" lock.
